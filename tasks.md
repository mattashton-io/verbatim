# Development Roadmap: verbatim

## Current Status
- README exists with GCP deployment steps.
- Core task identified: Add a login page.

## Proposed Tasks
- [ ] Implement a secure login page before allowing access to the application.
- [ ] Setup a simple authentication system (e.g., using Flask-Login).
- [ ] Add instructions for environment variable configuration for GCP deployment.
- [ ] Upgrade Opportunity: Instead of a custom login page, implement Google OAuth2 or Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) for more secure and enterprise-ready authentication.
